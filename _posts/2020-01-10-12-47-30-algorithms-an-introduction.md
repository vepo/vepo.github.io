> _The NOTION of an algorithm is basic to all computer programming._ 
> Donald E. Knuth

Even you do not care about algorithms, if you program in any programming language you use, produce and read algorithms. 

A Programming Language is the language you can express algorithms to the computer can understand it. So, here I want to make a difference between Programming Languages and Presentation Languages. HTML for me is not a programming language... No worries if you believe it is. ü§ì

# Defining Algorithms

The [Oxford Dictionary](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/algorithm) define algorithm as:

> A set of rules that must be followed when solving a particular problem.

Any computer program is developed to solve a problem. _Or to create a problem... no worries_ üòâ

So a program **SHOULD** follow a Recipe, and that is the algorithm. This is ubiquitous in any computing.

## Characteristics

An algorithm is a recipe, but a recipe is not an algorithm. Why? You can understand a recipe, but a computer cannot! You are much smarter than a computer. 

To be an algorithm, a set of rules must have the following features

1. Finiteness
2. Definiteness
3. Input
4. Output
5. Effectiveness


### 1. Finiteness

An algorithm **SHOULD** always terminate after a finite number of steps. 

There are some algorithms that search infinitely for a optimal value. Even this kind of algorithms should have a end, probably an finite number of iterations or an _"stable"_ value. 

### 2. Definiteness

Each step of an algorithm **SHOULD** be precisely defined. 

You can make assumptions about something you read, but a computer cannot make any assumption. Each step should be precise.

[!["Determinism" from monkeyuser.com with description "Assumptions are the mother of all fuck ups!"](/assets/images/monkeyuser/148-determinism.png)](https://www.monkeyuser.com/2019/determinism/)

Imagine an algorithm that says:

> Divide m by n and assign x with the value

This step is defined? No! You can make questions to this step: _Is x an Integer value?_ If we have `m=4` and `n=3`, the result in `x` can be `x=1` or `x=1.333`. Depending from the algorithm it can be any value.

The correct step should be:

> Assign the x (integer) with the value of m divided by n

In an algorithm there is no space for questions in steps.

### 3. Input

An algorithm has zero or more _inputs_.

### 4. Output

An algorithm has one or more _outputs_.

### 5. Effectiveness

All steps need to be effective, that means it should be simple enough to be done without any other knowledge

# Notation

For writing an algorithm we need:
* Numbered steps: We should be able to refer to steps
* Pseudocode: We should be able to translate the algorithm in any programming language
* Given inputs
* Given outputs
* Assignments: This represents when a variable assume a new value. Normally we use the notation `x ‚Üê y`where means that `x` will be attributed the value of `y`.

# Sorting a array

How can I sort an array of integers?

```
GIVEN:
    v    ‚Üí The given array
    n    ‚Üí The length of the given array
    x[i] ‚Üí The value stored in the position i from the array x

START:
  S1: FOR EACH i IN [0, n - 2]:
  S2:   min_index ‚Üê i
  S3:   FOR EACH j IN [i + 1, n - 1]:
  S4:     IF v[j] < v[min_index]?
  S5:       min_index ‚Üê j
  S6:   IF v[i] != v[min_index]?
  S7:     aux ‚Üê v[min_index]
  S8:     v[min_index] ‚Üê v[i]
  S9:     v[i] ‚Üê aux
```

About this algorithm we can ask:

1. **Is it finite?** Yes, it will iterate over the array.
2. **Is it definite?** Yes, every step can be done without any assumption.
3. **What is the input?** The array and it's length.
4. **What is the output?** The same array, every change is made inplace
5. **Is it effective?** Yes, it will sort any array.

```

As we can see, given the input `[5, 100, -6, 98, -111, 0]`, it returns the output `[-111, -6, 0, 5, 98, 100]`. So in the output there is no value `v[i]` and `v[j]` where `i < j` and `v[i] > v[j]`, that means the array is sorted.
